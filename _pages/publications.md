**Extreme Lockdowns and the Gendered Informalization of Employment**<br>_revise and resubmit_

<details>
  <summary>Brief Abstract</summary>
  
The adverse effects of COVID-19 on labor market outcomes are amplified by and partly attributable to the imposition of extreme mobility restrictions. While gendered disparities in job losses and working hours reduction have been demonstrated in the literature, is an informalization of employment observed, and is this phenomenon likewise gendered? This article analyses the Philippines, a country that imposed one of the world’s longest and strictest lockdowns, specifically how its imposition affected informal employment. A conceptual and empirical distinction between compositional and survivalist informalization is proffered—the former referring to informality induced by changes in the size and composition of overall employment, and the latter on informality induced by the need to work absent sufficient welfare support and precautionary household savings. Leveraging the regional variation in lockdowns in a difference-in-differences design, results demonstrate that, indeed, extreme lockdowns increase the probability of informal employment, conditional on being employed, for women but not for men.

**On Fertility Intentions Under Future Caregiving and Employment Uncertainties: Evidence from a Vignette Experiment
**<br>with Michaela Kreyenfeld, Enrique Alonso Perez, Paul Gellert, Jan Paul Heisig, and Julie O'Sullivan<br>_ongoing_

<details>
  <summary>Brief Abstract</summary>
  
While the impact of present-time uncertainties on fertility intentions has been established, there is limited research on the effects of future uncertainties, particularly that of simultaneous and multiple types. Using a vignette experiment from the nationally representative German Socio-Economic Panel Innovation Sample (n=1,750), we analyze the effects of both future caregiving and employment uncertainties on respondent-assessed fertility intentions. Results show that having no female caregiving responsibilities and no employment uncertainty for both partners in the foreseeable future increase fertility intentions by 2.8 and 1.9 units respectively on a 0-10 scale, relative to when future uncertainties are high. These estimates are robust to the inclusion of salient vignette information and respondents’ own socio-demographic and employment characteristics. Using interaction models to analyze the combined effect of multiple future uncertainties, we find additive effects such that fertility intentions are most pronounced when there are no future caregiving responsibilities and both partners are in secure employment. While we find gendered differences in the effect of caregiving uncertainty, we find no evidence that respondents’ evaluation of the vignettes was moderated by their own employment characteristics. Broadly, results highlight individual perceptions of the enabling conditions for initiating parenthood and concerns on family formation in aging societies.

**Bad Jobs During Bad Times: "Double Scarring" Effects on Fertility Behavior**<br> _ongoing_

<details>
  <summary>Brief Abstract</summary>
  
The conditions upon labor market entry have been demonstrated to affect future employment and family formation outcomes. A thick strand of the literature suggests that entering the labor market with some form of employment uncertainty typically leads to postponed childbearing, lower probabilities of parenthood, or both. Yet it is not only individual working conditions that matter. Broader macroeconomic conditions also matter. Indeed, the “scarring” literature likewise demonstrates how graduating in a recession year negatively affects the above-mentioned outcomes when compared to those who graduated during normal times. This paper speaks to these two strands and examines whether a “double scarring” effect exists for those who enter the labor market with a fixed-term contract during recessions on the timing of first childbirth. Preliminarily, we employ matching methods using detailed employment and birth histories of labor market entrants in the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP).

**Too Little, Too Weak? Family Policies and Workers' Bargaining Response**<br> _ongoing_

<details>
  <summary>Brief Abstract</summary>
  
When statutory provisions for family policies are deemed insufficient, how do workers respond and compensate? Looking at advanced economies points us to an idea—unionization and collective bargaining are ways to afford workers better working conditions as well as increase benefit entitlement compared to what is statutorily guaranteed. An analysis of whether this pattern holds in developing countries with weaker labor movements and social protection mechanisms is scarce and limited by the unavailability of data on collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). We use a novel dataset of all workplace CBAs in the Philippines from 2016-2021 to: (1) descriptively show the prevalence of family policies in CBAs and (2) analyze the causal effects of a 2019 maternity leave reform, which increased benefit entitlement from 7-8 weeks to 15 weeks, on the inclusion of family provisions in CBAs using a quasi-experimental design. Preliminarily descriptive findings suggest that beyond augmentation, precautionary protection is a collective bargaining gain in developing countries where compliance and enforcement are weak.
