About
------
I am a PhD candidate at the [DYNAMICS PhD Program](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/about-dynamics) based at the [Hertie School Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) and [Humboldt University Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en) under the joint supervision of [Prof. Mark Hallerberg, PhD](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/research/faculty-and-researchers/profile/person/hallerberg) and [Prof. Dr. Michaela Kreyenfeld](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/research/faculty-and-researchers/profile/person/kreyenfeld). 

My current research interests are broadly on the causes and demographic consequences of labor market precarity. In the first strand, I look at how policies and structural factors shape precarious (e.g. informal, nonstandard) employment. In the second strand, I analyze the effects of these types of employment on later-life family formation outcomes. Tangential to these is an interest in the growing exercise of labor market power and its effects on both collective bargaining and individual career trajectories. I employ quantitative methods (descriptive and quasi-experimental) on both representative surveys and novel hand-encoded data.

Prior to starting the PhD, I obtained an MPP from the Hertie School Berlin and a BS in Economics from the University of the Philippines-Diliman. I was a staff member at the Philippine Competition Commission's Economics Office and a Senior Lecturer at the University of the Philippines-Baguio where I taught undergraduate courses on Labor and Economic Demography. During the Spring 2023 semester, I am a visiting PhD student researcher at the [University of California Berkeley](https://www.demog.berkeley.edu/) (Department of Demography).
