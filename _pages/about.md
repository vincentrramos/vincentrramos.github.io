About
------
I am a PhD candidate at the [DYNAMICS PhD Program](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/about-dynamics) based at the [Hertie School Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) and [Humboldt University Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en) under the joint supervision of [Mark Hallerberg](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/research/faculty-and-researchers/profile/person/hallerberg) and [Michaela Kreyenfeld](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/research/faculty-and-researchers/profile/person/kreyenfeld). 

Beginning in the early summer of 2024, I am joining the [Centre for Population Change-Connecting Generations](https://www.cpc.ac.uk/research_programme/connecting_generations/#Current) Team at the University of Southampton as a postdoctoral researcher, working with [Ann Berrington](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5wyht9/professor-ann-berrington).

My current research interests are broadly on the **causes and demographic consequences of employment uncertainty**. In the first strand, I look at how policies and structural factors shape precarious (i.e. informal) employment. In the second strand, I analyze the effects of these types of employment on living arrangements and family formation outcomes. Tangential to these is an interest in the growing exercise of labor market power and its effects on both collective bargaining and subsequent employment and life course outcomes. I employ quantitative methods (descriptive, quasi-experimental, and experimental designs) on both representative surveys and novel hand-encoded data.

Before starting the PhD, I obtained an MPP from the Hertie School Berlin and a BS in Economics from the University of the Philippines-Diliman. I was a staff member at the Philippine Competition Commission's Economics Office and a Senior Lecturer at the University of the Philippines-Baguio where I taught undergraduate courses on Labor and Economic Demography. During the Spring 2023 semester, I was a visiting PhD student researcher at the [University of California Berkeley](https://www.demog.berkeley.edu/) (Department of Demography).
