About
------
I am a PhD candidate at the [DYNAMICS PhD Program](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/about-dynamics) under the joint supervision of Prof. Mark Hallerberg, PhD and Prof. Dr. Michaela Kreyenfeld. 

My current research interests are broadly on the causes and consequences of labor market precarity. In the first strand, I look at how policies and structural factors shape precarious (e.g. informal, nonstandard) employment. In the second strand, I analyze the effects of these types of employment on later life family formation outcomes. Tangential to these is an interest in the growing exercise of labor market power and its effects on both collective bargaining and individual career trajectories. I employ quantitative methods (descriptive and quasi-experimental) on representative survey data.

Prior to starting the PhD, I obtained an MPP from the Hertie School Berlin and a BS in Economics from the University of the Philippines-Diliman. I was a staff member at the Philippine Competition Commission's Economics Office and a Senior Lecturer at the University of the Philippines-Baguio where I taught undergraduate courses on Labor and Economic Demography.

During the Spring 2023 semester, I am a visiting PhD student researcher at the [University of California Berkeley](https://www.demog.berkeley.edu/) (Department of Demography).
