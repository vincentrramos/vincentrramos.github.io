About
------

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Centre for Population Change-Connecting Generations](https://www.cpc.ac.uk/research_programme/connecting_generations/#Current) at the University of Southampton, working with [Ann Berrington](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5wyht9/professor-ann-berrington) on employment precarity and intergenerational coresidence.

I recently obtained my PhD from the [DYNAMICS Program](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/about-dynamics) based at the [Hertie School Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) and [Humboldt University Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en) under the joint supervision of [Mark Hallerberg](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/research/faculty-and-researchers/profile/person/hallerberg) and [Michaela Kreyenfeld](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/research/faculty-and-researchers/profile/person/kreyenfeld). 


My current research interests revolve around three substantive areas: 

(1) workers' demographic  responses to employment uncertainty;

(2) workers' mobilization responses to insufficiency and discontent; and

(3) workers' belief responses to firms' exercise of power. 

I employ a wide range of quantitative methods (descriptive, quasi-experimental, and experimental designs) on both representative surveys and novel collected data focusing on country-specific contexts.

Before starting the PhD, I completed my Master's from the Hertie School Berlin and my Bachelor's from the University of the Philippines-Diliman. I was a staff member at the Philippine Competition Commission's Economics Office and a Senior Lecturer at the University of the Philippines-Baguio where I taught undergraduate courses on Labor and Economic Demography. During the Spring 2023 semester, I was a visiting PhD student researcher at the [University of California Berkeley](https://www.demog.berkeley.edu/) (Department of Demography).
