About
------

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southampton, within the [ESRC Centre for Population Change-Connecting Generations](https://www.cpc.ac.uk/research_programme/connecting_generations/#Current) Project, working on topics around employment uncertainty, life course, and intergenerational support. I obtained my PhD in 2024 from the [DYNAMICS Program](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/about-dynamics) based at the [Hertie School Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) and [Humboldt University Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en). 

My current research interests revolve around three substantive areas: (i) workers' demographic  responses to employment uncertainty; (ii) workers' mobilization responses to insufficiency and discontent; and (iii) workers' belief responses to firms' exercise of power. I employ a wide range of quantitative methods (descriptive, quasi-experimental, and experimental designs) on both representative surveys and novel collected data, focusing on country-specific contexts.
